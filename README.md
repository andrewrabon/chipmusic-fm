# ChipMusic.fm

## About

Hey there! Thanks for showing interest in [ChipMusic.fm](https://chipmusic.fm), an open-source, progressive web app music player for the music found on [ChipMusic.org](http://chipmusic.org).

## Browser Support

ChipMusic.fm works best on the latest versions of Chrome, Opera and Firefox. Safari kinda hates it right now. Haven't tested on Edge yet.

## Tech

ChipMusic.fm has been built with vanilla JavaScript (soon to be rewritten to take advantage of Web Components) and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com).

I know the code is kind of this giant monolith right now but I'll be doing a major refactor as soon as I can.
